Fork of [official](https://github.com/ftexchange/ftx) examples repository

At the moment, the repository contains functionality sufficient to communicate
with the [ftx](https://docs.ftx.com/#rest-api) API and listen to websockets. 
It is planned that in the future I will put these components together to
configure the data collection system.

### TO-DO

Must start downloading data from an arbitrary point in time, following the next algorithm:
1. Write a message about the launch to the logs in the `logs` folder
2. Create a file for the current data, called `dd-mm-yyyy`. *!*Each *new* file should start with a snapshot of the orderbook.
3. Record incoming updates to the file before the occurrence of stopping events
4. When an error occurs, write its text to the telegram and log the error message and stop the download
5. At the onset of 23:59:59 begin with step 1)
